      "taskTitle": "Implement oEmbed and Open Graph Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of oEmbed and Open Graph integration into detailed subtasks covering endpoint development, metadata handling, template modifications, testing strategies, and deployment considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing web standards (oEmbed and Open Graph) that require both backend API development and frontend template modifications. The task already has 9 subtasks with 4 completed. The complexity comes from handling different response formats, generating signed URLs, managing metadata, and ensuring proper integration with social platforms. The task requires understanding of multiple technologies and careful testing across various scenarios."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Cloud Run deployment setup into detailed subtasks covering Dockerfile optimization, CI/CD pipeline configuration, environment variable management, security settings, database connections, monitoring, and domain configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a complete production deployment infrastructure on Google Cloud Run. It requires deep knowledge of containerization, cloud infrastructure, security best practices, CI/CD pipelines, and database connectivity. The task already has 10 subtasks that cover various aspects of the deployment. The complexity is high due to the need to configure multiple interconnected cloud services, manage secrets securely, and ensure proper IAM permissions and networking."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of fixing FastMCP exception serialization context issues into detailed subtasks covering analysis of the current serialization mechanism, identifying failure points, designing improved serialization approaches, implementation, testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves debugging and fixing a complex serialization issue in the FastMCP framework. The task already has 8 subtasks that follow a logical progression. The complexity stems from needing to understand the internals of exception handling and serialization in a distributed system context, identifying subtle bugs in serialization logic, and ensuring backward compatibility while fixing the issues. It requires deep technical knowledge of Python's exception system and JSON-RPC serialization."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the resolution of architectural issues and technical debt into detailed subtasks covering analysis of current patterns, database operation optimization, import dependency mapping, exception handling standardization, implementation of improvements, testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task addresses fundamental architectural issues and technical debt across the codebase. The task already has 8 well-structured subtasks. The complexity is high because it requires deep understanding of the entire system architecture, identifying anti-patterns, and implementing systemic improvements that touch multiple components. It involves refactoring core functionality like exception handling, database operations, and module dependencies, which can have far-reaching impacts across the application."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the configuration of a development/staging environment into detailed subtasks covering architecture definition, Docker container setup, GCS bucket configuration, database setup, environment-specific settings, IAM permissions, CI/CD integration, monitoring, data seeding, security controls, testing procedures, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complete staging environment that bridges local development and production. The task already has 12 comprehensive subtasks. The complexity comes from needing to configure multiple interconnected components (Docker, GCS, databases, CI/CD) in a way that mimics production while still being suitable for testing and development. It requires understanding of cloud infrastructure, containerization, database management, and deployment automation."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the establishment of a comprehensive testing infrastructure into detailed subtasks covering pytest framework setup, database testing infrastructure, static analysis tool integration, security scanning implementation, and CI/CD integration with regression testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves building a complete testing infrastructure from scratch for a codebase with zero test coverage. The task already has 5 well-defined subtasks. The complexity is very high because it requires implementing multiple testing layers (unit, integration, functional), setting up static analysis, security scanning, database testing, and CI/CD integration. It touches every part of the codebase and development workflow, requiring expertise in testing methodologies, automation, and quality assurance practices."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a comprehensive database testing infrastructure into detailed subtasks covering framework foundation setup, migration testing, connection pool and transaction testing, full-text search testing, and data integrity validation testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on building a specialized testing infrastructure for database operations. The task already has 5 detailed subtasks. The complexity is high because it requires deep understanding of database concepts (migrations, connection pools, transactions, full-text search, data integrity) and how to test them effectively. It involves creating test fixtures, mocks, and validation strategies for complex database operations, which requires expertise in both testing methodologies and database management."

      "reasoning": "This task involves enhancing the CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive quality gates and validation processes. The task already has 5 well-structured subtasks. The complexity is high because it requires integrating multiple validation systems (testing, code quality, security scanning, database validation) into a cohesive workflow with appropriate gates and feedback mechanisms. It involves configuring GitHub Actions, implementing branch protection rules, setting up staged deployments, and creating monitoring dashboards, which requires expertise in DevOps practices and automation."
