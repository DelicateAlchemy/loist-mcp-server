      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks covering: oEmbed endpoint implementation (JSON and XML), Open Graph meta tag integration, Twitter Card tag integration, content negotiation, oEmbed discovery, platform-specific testing (Notion, Slack, Discord), local and production environment testing, deployment, domain/SSL configuration, error handling, documentation, and cross-platform compatibility validation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing two distinct but related web standards (oEmbed and Open Graph), handling both backend (API endpoint, content negotiation, discovery) and frontend (meta tags, template logic), and ensuring compatibility with multiple platforms. It also involves thorough testing in various environments and with real-world platforms, which adds significant complexity. The current subtasks are comprehensive but could be further broken down to address error handling, documentation, and platform-specific nuances, justifying a high complexity score and recommending additional subtasks."

      "reasoning": "This task encompasses the full production deployment lifecycle on Google Cloud, including containerization, CI/CD, secure secret management, database and storage integration, networking, monitoring, and security. Each area involves multiple configuration and validation steps, often requiring coordination between infrastructure and application code. The current subtasks are detailed but could be expanded to include CI/CD pipeline setup, rollback/disaster recovery, cost optimization, and more granular documentation and validation steps, reflecting a very high complexity and the need for additional subtasks."
