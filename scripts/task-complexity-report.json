      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup FastMCP Server Framework",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the FastMCP server setup into subtasks: project initialization, FastMCP server instantiation, authentication setup, server configuration (settings/env), error handling/logging, entry point/routing, CORS configuration, health check endpoint, and Docker setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task covers multiple foundational aspects: initializing a Python project, configuring FastMCP, setting up authentication, error handling, routing, CORS, health checks, and Docker. Each is a distinct concern, but none are deeply complex individually. The integration of all these elements justifies a moderate complexity and several subtasks."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Database and Storage Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for PostgreSQL schema design, database provisioning, GCS bucket setup, authentication and access control for GCS, database connection pooling, migration scripts, GCS lifecycle policies, and signed URL generation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both relational database and cloud storage setup, schema design, access control, lifecycle management, and integration between components. Each step is non-trivial and requires careful configuration, making this a high-complexity foundational task."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement HTTP URL Audio Downloader",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: HTTP/HTTPS download logic, file size validation, timeout/retry handling, SSRF protection, URL scheme validation, temporary file management, and progress tracking.",
      "reasoning": "The downloader must be robust and secure, handling validation, error cases, and security (SSRF). Each requirement is a separate technical concern, and the combination increases the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Audio Metadata Extraction",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: ID3 tag extraction, technical spec extraction (duration, channels, etc.), artwork extraction, format validation, error handling for missing/corrupt metadata, and support for multiple formats.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integration of multiple libraries, handling diverse audio formats, and robust error handling. Each extraction and validation step is distinct and can be complex depending on file variability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Audio Storage and Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: audio file upload to GCS, thumbnail upload, unique filename generation, GCS organization structure, temporary file cleanup, and upload retry logic.",
      "reasoning": "While GCS integration is well-documented, handling uploads, naming, organization, and cleanup requires careful orchestration, especially for reliability and maintainability."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Database Operations for Audio Metadata",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: save metadata function, retrieve by ID, full-text search implementation, status update logic, error/transaction management, and connection pooling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves transactional database operations, search, and error handling. Each function is a separate concern, and ensuring atomicity and performance adds to the complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement MCP Tool: process_audio_complete",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: tool input/output schema definition, downloader integration, metadata extraction integration, storage integration, database update, error handling, and response formatting.",
      "reasoning": "This is the primary orchestration point, integrating multiple modules into a processing pipeline. It requires careful coordination, error propagation, and contract adherence, making it highly complex."

      "taskTitle": "Implement MCP Tools: get_audio_metadata and search_library",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: get_audio_metadata tool implementation, search_library tool implementation, response formatting, database integration, error handling, and input validation.",
      "reasoning": "These tools are straightforward but must handle database integration, response formatting, and error cases. The complexity is moderate due to the need for robust, reusable interfaces."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement MCP Resources for Audio and Metadata",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: audio stream resource handler, metadata resource handler, thumbnail resource handler, signed URL caching, CORS/content-type configuration, error handling, and search resource endpoint.",
      "reasoning": "Resource endpoints must be secure, performant, and reliable. Handling signed URLs, caching, and proper HTTP semantics increases the technical demands."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement HTML5 Audio Player and Embed Page",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: HTML5 audio player UI, embed page routing, metadata display, playback controls, responsive layout, keyboard accessibility, and signed URL integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines frontend UI/UX, accessibility, and backend integration for signed URLs and metadata. Each aspect is distinct and requires attention to detail."
