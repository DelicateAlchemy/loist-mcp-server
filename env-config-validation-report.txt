SUMMARY:
========
The environment variable configuration is complete and validated across all deployment methods.
The system supports flexible configuration with proper security separation between sensitive
and non-sensitive values.

Recommendations:
- Use secrets for sensitive data (passwords, tokens, service account keys)
- Set environment-specific values in deployment configurations
- Regularly review and update environment variable documentation

For production deployment:
1. Set sensitive values via Google Cloud Secrets Manager
2. Configure environment-specific variables in cloudbuild.yaml
3. Use the provided documentation for team reference
