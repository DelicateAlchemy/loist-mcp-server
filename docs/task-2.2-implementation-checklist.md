  - [ ] Test backup restoration

- [ ] **Disaster Recovery**
  - [ ] Set up point-in-time recovery
  - [ ] Configure cross-region replication (if needed)
  - [ ] Document recovery procedures
  - [ ] Test disaster recovery scenarios

### Step 6: Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**
  - [ ] Configure Cloud Monitoring
