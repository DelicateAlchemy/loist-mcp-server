# Task ID: 13
# Title: Task #13: Fix FastMCP Exception Serialization Context Issues
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the issue where FastMCP's internal exception serialization fails due to missing exception classes during JSON-RPC serialization, ensuring proper exception handling in all execution contexts.
# Details:
To address this issue, ensure that all necessary exception classes are imported and available in the scope where FastMCP's serialization occurs. This may involve modifying the import structure or using a custom serialization mechanism that can handle exceptions in different execution contexts. Additionally, consider implementing a fallback strategy to handle exceptions that cannot be serialized properly, such as logging detailed error messages for debugging purposes while sending generic error responses to clients. Ensure that the solution is compatible with FastMCP's error handling mechanisms, including the use of `ResourceError` for controlled error messaging.

# Test Strategy:
Verify task completion by testing FastMCP tools under various error conditions, ensuring that exceptions are properly serialized and handled without causing `NameError` exceptions. Use both normal Python execution and FastMCP's JSON-RPC serialization process for comprehensive testing. Validate that error messages are correctly logged and that clients receive appropriate error responses. Utilize tools like `Client` from `fastmcp.client` to simulate client interactions and verify the server's response to errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze FastMCP exception class hierarchy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the current exception class structure in FastMCP to understand inheritance patterns and serialization attributes.
### Details:
Map out all exception classes in FastMCP, identify their inheritance relationships, document special attributes that need serialization, and determine which exception types are currently failing to serialize context properly. Create a diagram showing the exception hierarchy.

## 2. Investigate serialization mechanism failures [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Identify specific failure points in the current serialization process for exceptions.
### Details:
Set up debugging instrumentation to capture serialization failures, analyze stack traces, identify which context data is being lost during serialization, and determine if the issue is in serialization or deserialization. Document all edge cases found.

## 3. Design improved exception serialization approach [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create a technical design for enhancing exception serialization to preserve context.
### Details:
Design a solution that addresses identified issues, consider backward compatibility, evaluate performance implications, and document the proposed changes with code examples. Include handling for custom attributes, nested exceptions, and circular references.

## 4. Implement serialization mechanism modifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Code the changes to the exception serialization system based on the approved design.
### Details:
Implement the serialization enhancements, create custom serializers/deserializers if needed, modify exception base classes, and ensure proper context preservation across process boundaries. Include appropriate error handling for serialization failures.

## 5. Create comprehensive test suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Develop tests that verify exception serialization works correctly across different contexts.
### Details:
Create unit tests for each exception type, integration tests for cross-process scenarios, performance tests to measure overhead, and regression tests to ensure existing functionality remains intact. Include tests for edge cases identified during investigation.

## 6. Integrate with existing error handling systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Ensure the improved exception serialization works with FastMCP's error handling infrastructure.
### Details:
Update error logging mechanisms, ensure error reporting systems correctly display the preserved context, modify any middleware that processes exceptions, and verify compatibility with monitoring tools. Test error recovery scenarios.

## 7. Update documentation and developer guides [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4, 13.6
### Description: Revise all relevant documentation to reflect the changes to exception handling.
### Details:
Update API documentation, create examples showing proper exception usage, document any new methods or attributes, and provide migration guides for developers using the previous system. Include troubleshooting information for common issues.

## 8. Perform final validation and release [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5, 13.6, 13.7
### Description: Conduct comprehensive validation and prepare the changes for release.
### Details:
Run the full test suite in various environments, perform code reviews, validate documentation accuracy, prepare release notes highlighting the changes, and create a deployment plan that minimizes disruption to existing systems.
