# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup FastMCP Server Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the MCP server with FastMCP framework and configure the basic server structure with authentication.
# Details:
1. Create a new Python project with FastMCP framework
2. Configure server settings and environment variables
3. Implement simple bearer token authentication (hardcoded token for MVP)
4. Setup basic error handling and logging
5. Create the server entry point and routing structure
6. Configure CORS for cross-origin requests
7. Implement health check endpoint
8. Setup Docker configuration for local development

Code structure:
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, BearerAuth
import os

# Initialize FastMCP server
app = FastMCP(
    title="Music Library MCP",
    description="MCP server for audio ingestion and embedding",
    auth=BearerAuth(token=os.getenv("BEARER_TOKEN"))
)

# Register tools and resources
# (to be implemented in subsequent tasks)

# Start server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify server starts without errors
2. Test health check endpoint returns 200 OK
3. Verify authentication rejects requests without valid bearer token
4. Test CORS headers are properly set for cross-origin requests
5. Validate Docker container builds and runs correctly
6. Ensure logging is properly configured and captures relevant information

## 2. FastMCP Server Instantiation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create and configure the core FastMCP server instance.
### Details:
Instantiate the FastMCP class, optionally providing a name, instructions, and initial settings. This forms the foundation for adding tools, resources, and further configuration.
<info added on 2025-10-09T10:28:15.888Z>
Successfully configured the core FastMCP server instance with advanced settings:

**Configuration Management:**
- Created `src/config.py` with Pydantic Settings for type-safe configuration
- Centralized all settings with environment variable support
- Sensible defaults - server works out-of-the-box
- Configuration includes: server identity, runtime settings, logging, MCP protocol, duplicate policies, performance tuning, and feature flags

**Server Enhancement:**
- Enhanced server instantiation with all advanced FastMCP parameters
- Added `name`, `instructions`, `lifespan`, `on_duplicate_*` policies, `include_fastmcp_meta`
- Configured duplicate handling: tools=error, resources=warn, prompts=replace

**Lifespan Management:**
- Implemented async lifespan context manager
- Startup logs: server name, version, transport, log level, features
- Shutdown log with graceful cleanup
- Verified working: startup logs show correctly, shutdown executes properly

**Logging System:**
- Structured logging with configurable levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL)
- Support for both text and JSON formats
- Logger instances per module
- Health check includes debug logging

**Health Check Enhancement:**
- Extended to return: status, service, version, transport, log_level
- Provides comprehensive server state information

**Testing:**
- Configuration loads correctly with all settings
- Server instantiates with advanced parameters
- Lifespan hooks execute (startup and shutdown logs confirmed)
- Health check returns extended status
- All tools register properly

**Documentation:**
- Updated README.md with comprehensive configuration section
- Documented all environment variables and options
- Added configuration features list
- Updated project structure and feature lists

## 3. Authentication Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for the server.
### Details:
Integrate authentication middleware or decorators to secure endpoints. Define user roles and permissions as needed. This step may involve environment variables for secrets.
<info added on 2025-10-09T10:41:00.353Z>
Authentication middleware has been successfully implemented for the FastMCP server. The implementation includes a dedicated `src/auth/` module with a `SimpleBearerAuth` class that extends FastMCP's `AuthProvider`. The authentication system validates bearer tokens against a configured secret and returns an AccessToken containing client_id, scopes, and custom claims.

Key features include logging for authentication attempts, graceful handling when authentication is disabled, and proper integration with the FastMCP authentication system. The server integration is configurable through config.py with environment variable support via .env file, and includes conditional authentication based on the auth_enabled setting.

Comprehensive testing has verified functionality for valid tokens, invalid tokens, empty tokens, disabled mode, and multiple requests. The implementation is documented in the README with security best practices, usage instructions, and a future authentication roadmap that includes JWT, OAuth, and RBAC.

The authentication system is now production-ready for MVP with a clear upgrade path to more advanced authentication methods.

## 4. Server Configuration (Settings/Env) [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure server behavior using settings, environment variables, and .env files.
### Details:
Set host, port, log level, duplicate component policies, and other settings via constructor arguments, environment variables (FASTMCP_SERVER_*), or .env files. Access and validate settings as needed.
<info added on 2025-10-09T10:48:53.141Z>
The server configuration system has been implemented using Pydantic Settings in `src/config.py`, providing type-safe configuration with validation, environment variable support via .env files, and sensible defaults. The system configures server runtime settings (host, port, transport), logging options, duplicate component policies (tools, resources, prompts), authentication settings, MCP protocol configuration, performance parameters, and feature flags. 

Our implementation is compatible with FastMCP's environment variable approach but uses a cleaner naming convention (SERVER_HOST vs FASTMCP_SERVER_HOST). The configuration is centralized, supports environment variable overrides, includes type validation, and works with sensible defaults out-of-the-box.

Settings are accessible via a global config instance (`from config import config`), used throughout the server and authentication modules, and validated at startup with clear error messages. Comprehensive documentation has been added to README.md, including a complete Configuration section with all environment variables, examples, features list, and default values.
