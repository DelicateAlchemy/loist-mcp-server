# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup FastMCP Server Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the MCP server with FastMCP framework and configure the basic server structure with authentication.
# Details:
1. Create a new Python project with FastMCP framework
2. Configure server settings and environment variables
3. Implement simple bearer token authentication (hardcoded token for MVP)
4. Setup basic error handling and logging
5. Create the server entry point and routing structure
6. Configure CORS for cross-origin requests
7. Implement health check endpoint
8. Setup Docker configuration for local development

Code structure:
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, BearerAuth
import os

# Initialize FastMCP server
app = FastMCP(
    title="Music Library MCP",
    description="MCP server for audio ingestion and embedding",
    auth=BearerAuth(token=os.getenv("BEARER_TOKEN"))
)

# Register tools and resources
# (to be implemented in subsequent tasks)

# Start server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify server starts without errors
2. Test health check endpoint returns 200 OK
3. Verify authentication rejects requests without valid bearer token
4. Test CORS headers are properly set for cross-origin requests
5. Validate Docker container builds and runs correctly
6. Ensure logging is properly configured and captures relevant information

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Initialization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Python project environment, including virtual environment creation and dependency installation.
### Details:
Create a virtual environment, install FastMCP (and optionally WebSocket support), and verify installation. Initialize a new project directory with a basic structure (e.g., my_server.py).

# Project Initialization Complete

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.11.13 installed via Homebrew
- uv package manager (v0.9.0) installed and configured
- Virtual environment created at .venv/ using uv

## Project Structure
- Created directories: src/, tests/, docs/
- Created src/server.py with FastMCP initialization and health check tool
- Generated requirements.txt with all dependencies (61 packages)
- Created pyproject.toml with project metadata and configuration

## Dependencies Installed
- FastMCP 2.12.4 (with MCP 1.16.0)
- All required dependencies: fastmcp, pydantic, starlette, uvicorn, httpx, etc.

## Configuration
- Updated .gitignore with comprehensive Python patterns
- Configured pyproject.toml with black, ruff, and pytest settings

## Verification
- Server imports successfully without errors
- Health check tool properly registered with FastMCP
- FastMCP version verified: 2.12.4

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md created with installation instructions, project structure overview, development workflow, configuration guidelines, and API documentation for health check

## Branch
- Working on: init-mcp-fastmcp-basic-server-structure-authentication

# Verification Complete

## Server Testing Results
- Server imports without errors
- FastMCP initializes correctly (version 2.12.4, MCP 1.16.0)
- health_check tool is properly registered (1 tool total)
- health_check tool executes successfully
- Returns correct data structure:
  - status: "healthy"
  - service: "Music Library MCP" 
  - version: "0.1.0"

## Server Capabilities Verified
- STDIO transport working (default MCP mode)
- Tool registration system functional  
- Can be run in dev mode with MCP Inspector

## Run Commands
- `python src/server.py` - Production STDIO mode
- `fastmcp dev src/server.py` - Development with Inspector

## Project Status
All temporary test files cleaned up. Project initialization is 100% complete and verified working.

## 2. FastMCP Server Instantiation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create and configure the core FastMCP server instance.
### Details:
Instantiate the FastMCP class, optionally providing a name, instructions, and initial settings. This forms the foundation for adding tools, resources, and further configuration.

## 3. Authentication Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for the server.
### Details:
Integrate authentication middleware or decorators to secure endpoints. Define user roles and permissions as needed. This step may involve environment variables for secrets.

## 4. Server Configuration (Settings/Env) [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure server behavior using settings, environment variables, and .env files.
### Details:
Set host, port, log level, duplicate component policies, and other settings via constructor arguments, environment variables (FASTMCP_SERVER_*), or .env files. Access and validate settings as needed.

## 5. Error Handling & Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Implement centralized error handling and logging for the server.
### Details:
Add exception handlers, customize error responses, and configure logging levels and outputs. Ensure errors are logged appropriately for debugging and monitoring.

## 6. Entry Point, Routing, CORS, and Health Check [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Define the server entry point, route declarations, CORS configuration, and a health check endpoint.
### Details:
Specify the main entry script (if __name__ == '__main__': mcp.run()). Add route decorators for tools and resources. Configure CORS if serving web clients. Implement a /health endpoint for monitoring.

## 7. Docker Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Containerize the FastMCP server for deployment using Docker.
### Details:
Create a Dockerfile to build a container image, specifying the base Python image, copying project files, installing dependencies, and defining the container entry point. Optionally, use docker-compose for local development.
