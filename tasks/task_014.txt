# Task ID: 14
# Title: Resolve Architectural Issues and Technical Debt
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Address multiple architectural issues and technical debt by resolving premature status updates, consolidating exception handling patterns, and simplifying import dependencies.
# Details:
This task involves addressing three key areas of technical debt and architectural issues in the software development project. 

1. **Premature Status Updates**: Modify the `mark_as_processing()` function to handle non-existent database records gracefully. This can be achieved by either creating the record before calling the function or by enhancing the function to check for the existence of the record before attempting to update it. Ensure that this change does not introduce additional database queries unless necessary.

2. **Consolidate Exception Handling Patterns**: Evaluate the existing exception handling systems, including `ProcessAudioException`, `MusicLibraryError` hierarchy, `handle_tool_error()`, and FastMCP's built-in exception handling. Choose one primary approach and refactor the codebase to use it consistently across all modules. This will involve reviewing and updating exception handling in schemas.py, exceptions.py, error_utils.py, and any other relevant files.

3. **Simplify Import Chain Complexity**: Identify and simplify complex import dependencies that cause issues during FastMCP serialization. This may involve reorganizing modules, reducing circular dependencies, or using dependency injection techniques to improve code maintainability and reduce errors during serialization.

**Additional Considerations**: Ensure that all changes are thoroughly documented and include clear commit messages. Coordinate with the QA team to integrate these changes into the testing pipeline to verify their impact on overall system stability and performance.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the completion of this task, follow these steps:

1. **Premature Status Updates Test**:
   - Create a test case where a non-existent database record is attempted to be marked as processing.
   - Verify that the record is either created before being marked as processing or that the function handles the absence of the record gracefully without raising an error.

2. **Consolidated Exception Handling Test**:
   - Write test cases for each type of exception handling scenario (e.g., audio processing errors, music library errors).
   - Ensure that all exceptions are handled consistently using the chosen primary approach.
   - Validate that the refactored code does not introduce new errors or inconsistencies in exception handling.

3. **Import Chain Complexity Test**:
   - Perform serialization tests with FastMCP to ensure that the simplified import dependencies do not cause errors.
   - Use different execution contexts to verify that the changes do not introduce new issues during serialization.

**Integration Testing**: Conduct thorough integration tests to ensure that these changes do not negatively impact other parts of the system. This includes testing for any potential regressions in functionality or performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Current Exception Handling Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and document all existing exception handling approaches including ProcessAudioException, MusicLibraryError hierarchy, handle_tool_error(), and FastMCP's built-in exception handling mechanisms.
### Details:
Review exceptions.py, error_utils.py, schemas.py and identify all exception types and handling patterns. Create a comprehensive audit report comparing each approach's strengths, weaknesses, and usage frequency across the codebase. Document the current state before making changes.

## 2. Resolve Premature Status Updates in mark_as_processing() [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the mark_as_processing() function to gracefully handle non-existent database records without introducing unnecessary database queries.
### Details:
Implement record existence checks before status updates. Choose between pre-creating records or adding defensive checks within the function. Measure database query impact before and after implementation. Update function documentation and add inline comments explaining the handling logic.

## 3. Select Primary Exception Handling Approach [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Based on the audit findings, select one primary exception handling strategy to standardize across the codebase.
### Details:
Compare all four exception handling systems evaluated in subtask 1. Document the rationale for choosing the selected approach. Consider consistency, performance, maintainability, and compatibility with FastMCP serialization. Create detailed guidelines for implementing the chosen approach.

## 4. Refactor Exception Handling Across Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Systematically refactor all exception handling code to use the selected primary approach consistently across all modules.
### Details:
Update exceptions.py, error_utils.py, schemas.py, and all other relevant files to use the standardized exception handling. Replace ProcessAudioException, MusicLibraryError hierarchy, and other approaches with the selected pattern. Ensure backward compatibility where necessary. Create clear migration path for deprecated exception types.

## 5. Simplify Import Dependencies and Resolve Serialization Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Identify and resolve complex import dependencies and circular import patterns that cause FastMCP serialization failures.
### Details:
Map import chains and circular dependencies in the codebase. Reorganize modules to eliminate problematic patterns. Consider dependency injection to decouple modules. Test FastMCP serialization after each change. Document the new module structure and import guidelines for future development.
