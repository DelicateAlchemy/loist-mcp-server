# Task ID: 15
# Title: Task #15: Configure Development/Staging Environment with Docker and GCS Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up a comprehensive staging environment that bridges local development and production, providing a production-like setup with containerization, test data, and automated deployment pipelines for integration testing and QA.
# Details:
1. Docker Configuration:
   - Create a staging-specific Dockerfile that mirrors production but includes debugging tools
   - Configure Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration in staging
   - Implement volume mounting for easy configuration updates without rebuilds
   - Set up networking to mimic production service communication

2. Database Setup:
   - Create a staging database instance with schema matching production
   - Develop scripts to populate staging database with anonymized production-like test data
   - Implement database migration tools that can be tested in staging before production
   - Configure database backup/restore procedures for staging refreshes

3. GCS Staging Bucket:
   - Create dedicated Google Cloud Storage buckets for staging environment
   - Implement proper IAM permissions that mirror production but allow testing access
   - Configure lifecycle policies for test data management and cleanup
   - Set up staging-specific object prefixes/naming conventions

4. Environment Configuration:
   - Create staging-specific environment variable sets
   - Implement environment-specific MCP server naming conventions that include staging branch context
   - Configure logging with staging-specific log levels (more verbose than production)
   - Set up monitoring and alerting with different thresholds than production

5. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Utilize existing cloudbuild-staging.yaml configuration
   - Integrate with GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on dev branch pushes
   - Configure automated deployments to staging after successful test runs
   - Implement staging-specific smoke tests post-deployment
   - Create rollback procedures for failed staging deployments
   - Resolve IAM permissions for service account deployment issues

6. Documentation:
   - Document the staging environment architecture and configuration
   - Create developer guides for using the staging environment
   - Document procedures for refreshing staging with production-like data

# Test Strategy:
1. Environment Validation:
   - Verify Docker containers start correctly with staging configurations
   - Confirm all services can communicate with each other as expected
   - Validate that staging environment variables are correctly loaded
   - Verify MCP server naming conventions are properly implemented with staging branch context

2. Database Testing:
   - Confirm staging database is accessible with correct credentials
   - Verify database schema matches production schema
   - Test data anonymization by ensuring no production PII exists in staging
   - Validate database migration scripts work correctly in staging

3. GCS Integration Testing:
   - Verify file uploads/downloads to staging GCS buckets
   - Confirm IAM permissions are correctly set for staging access
   - Test lifecycle policies by creating and observing test objects
   - Validate bucket naming conventions and object organization

4. Deployment Pipeline Testing:
   - Test GitHub Actions workflow triggers on dev branch pushes
   - Verify Cloud Build correctly processes cloudbuild-staging.yaml
   - Execute full CI/CD pipeline to staging and verify successful deployment
   - Test rollback procedures by intentionally deploying a broken build
   - Verify staging-specific smoke tests correctly identify issues
   - Confirm service account has proper IAM permissions for deployments
   - Measure deployment times and optimize if necessary

5. Integration Testing:
   - Run full integration test suite against staging environment
   - Perform load testing to verify performance characteristics
   - Execute security scans against staging environment
   - Validate that staging environment closely mimics production behavior

6. Documentation Review:
   - Have team members follow documentation to access and use staging
   - Verify all configuration steps are accurately documented
   - Test data refresh procedures by following documentation
   - Collect feedback on documentation clarity and completeness
