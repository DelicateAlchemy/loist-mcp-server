# Task ID: 17
# Title: Task #17: Implement Comprehensive Database Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement a robust database testing infrastructure to address the current lack of database testing capabilities, covering migration testing, connection pools, transactions, full-text search, and data integrity validation.
# Details:
This task requires building a complete database testing framework that integrates with the existing testing infrastructure (Task #16) and properly tests all database operations (Task #6). Implementation should include:

1. Database Migration Testing:
   - Create tests for all existing migrations to ensure they apply and roll back correctly
   - Implement tests for migration idempotency
   - Set up validation for migration dependencies and ordering

2. Connection Pool Testing:
   - Develop tests for connection acquisition and release
   - Implement stress tests for connection pool limits and timeout handling
   - Create tests for connection pool configuration validation

3. Transaction Testing:
   - Build tests for transaction commit and rollback scenarios
   - Implement tests for nested transactions if applicable
   - Create tests for transaction isolation levels
   - Test transaction timeout and deadlock detection

4. Full-Text Search Validation:
   - Develop tests for search index creation and updates
   - Implement tests for various search queries (exact match, fuzzy search, etc.)
   - Create performance tests for search operations
   - Test search result relevance and ranking

5. Data Integrity Testing:
   - Implement tests for constraint enforcement (foreign keys, unique constraints)
   - Create tests for data validation rules
   - Develop tests for data consistency across related tables
   - Implement tests for handling edge cases (NULL values, boundary conditions)

The implementation should use pytest fixtures for database setup and teardown, and should support both unit tests with mocked database connections and integration tests with real database instances. All tests should be designed to run in CI/CD pipelines and should not depend on production data.

# Test Strategy:
The completion of this task will be verified through the following approach:

1. Code Review:
   - Verify that all required test categories are implemented (migrations, connection pools, transactions, full-text search, data integrity)
   - Ensure tests follow best practices for database testing (proper setup/teardown, isolation, etc.)
   - Check that tests are well-documented with clear purpose for each test case

2. Test Coverage Analysis:
   - Run coverage reports to ensure at least 85% code coverage for database-related modules
   - Verify that all critical database operations have corresponding test cases
   - Ensure edge cases and error conditions are covered

3. Test Execution:
   - All implemented tests must pass in the local development environment
   - Tests must pass in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Tests should run within acceptable time limits (define specific thresholds)

4. Integration Verification:
   - Confirm tests work with the testing infrastructure from Task #16
   - Verify tests properly validate database operations from Task #6
   - Ensure tests can be run independently or as part of the full test suite

5. Documentation:
   - Review documentation for setting up and running database tests
   - Verify examples are provided for adding new database tests
   - Ensure test fixtures and utilities are properly documented

6. Performance Validation:
   - Verify that database tests don't significantly slow down the overall test suite
   - Ensure resource cleanup after tests complete
   - Check that tests can be parallelized when appropriate

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Database Testing Framework Foundation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core infrastructure for database testing, including pytest fixtures for database setup/teardown and configuration for both unit and integration test environments.
### Details:
Implement a base TestDatabase class that handles connection management, test database creation/destruction, and transaction isolation between tests. Create pytest fixtures at different scopes (function, module, session) to support various testing needs. Set up configuration to support both mocked database connections for unit tests and real database instances for integration tests. Implement environment detection to configure test databases appropriately in local and CI environments.

## 2. Implement Database Migration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests for database migrations, ensuring they apply and roll back correctly, are idempotent, and have proper dependencies.
### Details:
Create a MigrationTestRunner class that can apply migrations in sequence and verify their effects. Implement tests that apply each migration individually and verify the resulting schema matches expectations. Create tests that apply migrations and then roll them back to verify rollback functionality. Develop tests for migration idempotency by applying the same migration twice. Implement validation for migration dependencies and ordering by analyzing the migration graph.

## 3. Develop Connection Pool and Transaction Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create tests for database connection pools and transaction management, including stress tests, timeout handling, and various transaction scenarios.
### Details:
Implement ConnectionPoolTests class to verify connection acquisition, release, and proper pooling behavior. Create stress tests that simulate multiple concurrent connections to test pool limits. Develop timeout tests using controlled delays. For transactions, implement TransactionTests class covering commit, rollback, nested transactions, and isolation levels. Create tests for transaction timeout and deadlock detection by deliberately creating conflicting transactions.

## 4. Build Full-Text Search Testing Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop tests for full-text search functionality, including index creation, query execution, and performance validation.
### Details:
Create SearchIndexTests class to verify search index creation and updates. Implement SearchQueryTests class with test cases for various search types (exact match, fuzzy search, prefix/suffix matching). Develop performance tests that measure search operation timing with different dataset sizes. Implement relevance testing by creating datasets with known relevance patterns and verifying search results match expected ordering.

## 5. Implement Data Integrity and Validation Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create tests for database constraints, data validation rules, consistency across related tables, and handling of edge cases.
### Details:
Develop ConstraintTests class to verify enforcement of database constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints). Implement ValidationTests class to test application-level data validation rules. Create ConsistencyTests class to verify data remains consistent across related tables after operations. Develop EdgeCaseTests class covering NULL values, boundary conditions, and other special cases. Implement a test data generator that creates diverse test data including edge cases.
