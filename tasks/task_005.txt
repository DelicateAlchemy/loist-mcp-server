# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Audio Storage and Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a module to store processed audio files in Google Cloud Storage and manage their lifecycle.
# Details:
1. Upload processed audio files to Google Cloud Storage
2. Upload extracted thumbnails (album artwork) to GCS
3. Generate unique filenames based on UUID
4. Implement file organization structure in GCS
5. Handle cleanup of temporary local files
6. Implement retry logic for failed uploads

```python
import uuid
import os
from google.cloud import storage

def upload_to_gcs(local_file_path, destination_blob_name, bucket_name):
    """Upload a file to Google Cloud Storage bucket."""
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)
    
    blob.upload_from_filename(local_file_path)
    
    return f"gs://{bucket_name}/{destination_blob_name}"

def store_audio_file(local_audio_path, local_thumbnail_path=None):
    """Store audio file and thumbnail in GCS with proper organization."""
    # Generate a unique ID for this audio file
    audio_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # Define GCS paths
    audio_blob_name = f"audio/{audio_id}/audio{os.path.splitext(local_audio_path)[1]}"
    thumbnail_blob_name = f"audio/{audio_id}/thumbnail.jpg" if local_thumbnail_path else None
    
    # Upload audio file
    bucket_name = os.getenv("GCS_BUCKET_NAME")
    audio_gcs_path = upload_to_gcs(local_audio_path, audio_blob_name, bucket_name)
    
    # Upload thumbnail if available
    thumbnail_gcs_path = None
    if local_thumbnail_path:
        thumbnail_gcs_path = upload_to_gcs(local_thumbnail_path, thumbnail_blob_name, bucket_name)
    
    # Clean up local temporary files
    try:
        os.unlink(local_audio_path)
        if local_thumbnail_path:
            os.unlink(local_thumbnail_path)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error cleaning up temporary files: {e}")
    
    return {
        "audio_id": audio_id,
        "audio_path": audio_gcs_path,
        "thumbnail_path": thumbnail_gcs_path
    }
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test uploading various audio formats to GCS
2. Verify thumbnail uploads work correctly
3. Test unique ID generation and file organization
4. Validate cleanup of temporary files
5. Test retry logic for failed uploads
6. Verify GCS paths are correctly formatted
7. Test with large files to ensure proper handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Generate Unique Filenames for Uploads [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mechanism to generate unique filenames for both audio and thumbnail files to prevent naming collisions in GCS.
### Details:
Implement a function that combines elements such as UUIDs, timestamps, or user identifiers to ensure each uploaded file has a unique name.

## 2. Define GCS Organization Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design and document the folder and naming conventions for storing audio and thumbnail files in Google Cloud Storage.
### Details:
Establish a logical directory structure (e.g., by user, date, or file type) and ensure the unique filenames are incorporated into this structure.

## 3. Implement Audio File Upload to GCS [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop the logic to upload audio files to the designated GCS bucket and path using the unique filename and organization structure.
### Details:
Use server-side code to securely upload audio files, handle errors, and confirm successful uploads.

## 4. Implement Thumbnail Upload to GCS [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop the logic to upload thumbnail images to the appropriate GCS location using the same naming and organization conventions.
### Details:
Ensure thumbnail uploads follow the same security and reliability standards as audio file uploads.

## 5. Implement Upload Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add robust retry mechanisms to both audio and thumbnail upload processes to handle transient failures and improve reliability.
### Details:
Incorporate exponential backoff or similar strategies to automatically retry failed uploads, logging errors as needed.

## 6. Temporary File Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Ensure any temporary files created during the upload process are deleted after successful upload or upon failure.
### Details:
Implement cleanup routines to remove temporary files from the server or local environment to prevent resource leaks.
