PostgreSQL Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audio_tracks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING', -- PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED
  
  -- Metadata from ID3 tags
  artist VARCHAR(255),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  album VARCHAR(255),
  genre VARCHAR(255),
  year INTEGER,
  
  -- Technical specs
  duration FLOAT,
  channels INTEGER,
  sample_rate INTEGER,
  bitrate INTEGER,
  format VARCHAR(20),
  
  -- Storage paths
  audio_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  thumbnail_path TEXT,
  
  -- Search vector
  search_vector TSVECTOR
);

-- Create GIN index for full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_audio_tracks_search ON audio_tracks USING GIN(search_vector);

-- Function to update search vector
CREATE FUNCTION audio_tracks_search_update() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.search_vector := 
    setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.artist, '')), 'A') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.title, '')), 'A') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.album, '')), 'B') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.genre, '')), 'C');
  RETURN NEW;
END
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger to update search vector
CREATE TRIGGER audio_tracks_search_update_trigger
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON audio_tracks
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE audio_tracks_search_update();
```

GCS Configuration:
```python
from google.cloud import storage
import datetime

def create_gcs_client():
    return storage.Client()

def generate_signed_url(bucket_name, blob_name, expiration=15):
    """Generate a signed URL for a blob that expires in 'expiration' minutes."""
    storage_client = create_gcs_client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)
    
    url = blob.generate_signed_url(
        version="v4",
        expiration=datetime.timedelta(minutes=expiration),
        method="GET"
    )
    
    return url
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify database connection and schema creation
2. Test GCS bucket creation and access
3. Validate signed URL generation and expiration
4. Test database queries and full-text search functionality
5. Verify GCS lifecycle policies are correctly applied
6. Test database migration scripts
7. Validate connection pooling under load

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design PostgreSQL Database Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design normalized database schema following best practices including table structures, relationships, indexes, and constraints to ensure optimal query performance and data integrity.
### Details:
Create entity-relationship diagrams, define tables using at least third normal form, establish naming conventions, design for append-only patterns where applicable, implement constraints for data validation, and plan index strategy for common query patterns. Consider using multiple named schemas instead of multiple databases for better cross-schema access.

- GCS path validation constraints
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Migration tracking with checksums
- Rollback support (manual rollback required)

**Validation Status:**
- Schema follows PostgreSQL best practices

## 3. Create GCS Bucket and Configure Settings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provision Google Cloud Storage bucket with appropriate storage class, location, and versioning settings for application data storage.
### Details:
Create GCS bucket with appropriate naming convention, select storage class (Standard, Nearline, Coldline) based on access patterns, configure region/multi-region settings, enable versioning if needed, set up uniform or fine-grained access control, and configure CORS if required for browser access.
<info added on 2025-10-09T13:49:41.474Z>
GCS bucket "loist-music-library-audio" successfully created in us-central1 region with STANDARD storage class and uniform bucket-level access. Applied configuration includes production environment labels, CORS settings for browser-based audio streaming, and lifecycle policies for automatic deletion of temporary files. Directory structure established with audio/, thumbnails/, and temp/ folders.

Created comprehensive implementation including bucket provisioning script, GCS client module with signed URL generation, file operations, and metadata management. Added 25+ integration tests and complete documentation. Security features include private access with time-limited signed URLs (15-minute expiration), service account authentication, and HTTPS-only access.

Environment configuration established in .env.gcs with all necessary parameters. Cost estimation indicates approximately $7/month for 10K tracks (50GB) including storage and streaming costs.

All implementation code, tests, and documentation are complete. The bucket is production-ready with infrastructure code implemented and validated.
